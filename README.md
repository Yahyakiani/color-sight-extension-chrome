# Colorblind Mode Chrome Extension (ColorSight)

The Colorblind Mode Chrome Extension adjusts colors on web pages to accommodate different types of color blindness. This extension aims to make the internet a more inclusive place for people with color blindness, a condition affecting approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women worldwide.
How it works

The extension applies a color matrix to the colors on the webpage based on the selected colorblindness profile. The extension currently supports the following colorblindness profiles:

   - Protanopia
   - Deuteranopia
   - Tritanopia

When the extension is enabled, all colors on the webpage are modified to make them more distinguishable to people with color blindness.
How to use

To use the Colorblind Mode Chrome Extension:

   - Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
   - Click on the extension icon in the browser toolbar.
   - Select a colorblindness profile from the dropdown menu.
   - Click the "Enable Colorblind Mode" button to apply the color matrix to the current webpage.

To disable the extension, click on the extension icon and then click the "Disable Colorblind Mode" button.

## Advantages

The Colorblind Mode Chrome Extension offers several advantages:

   - Makes the internet more accessible to people with color blindness.
   - Helps developers create more accessible web content by allowing them to view their websites as someone with color blindness might see it.
   - Easy to use and switch on/off as needed.

## Limitations

It's important to note that the Colorblind Mode Chrome Extension has some limitations:

   - The extension does not work on all websites, as some websites may override the colors specified in CSS.
   - The extension may not work perfectly for all users with color blindness, as color blindness is a spectrum and everyone's vision is different.
